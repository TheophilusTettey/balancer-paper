#Macs summits that are deleted

Deletion by at least 50% (n=22, actually 17 non-redundant ones):

Region               | Nearby ASE gene? | Where is the CRE? | Comments

2L:16852302-16852422 | CG31809, CG13284 | summit at promoter (DEL along most of the gene) | Check gene CG31810 (FBgn0051810) it should be deleted in balancer!!
