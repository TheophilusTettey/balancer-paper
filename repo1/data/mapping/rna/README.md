# Overview of samples

> The raw files are spread across the file system but soft-linked into `fastq`

Name | Date | Stage/Tissue | Platform | Description
---  | ---  | ---          | ---      | ---
F0_VRG_4-8h     | January 2016 | 4-8h embryos     | HiSeq2000 |
F0_VRG_heads    | January 2016 | adult heads      | HiSeq2000 |
F1_CyOTM3_heads | January 2016 | adult heads      | HiSeq2000 |
N1_CyO_heads    | January 2016 | adult heads      | HiSeq2000 |
N1_TM3_heads    | January 2016 | adult heads      | HiSeq2000 |
N1_pool_4-8h    | June 2015    | 4-8h embryos     | ? | Initial high-cov embryonic RNA
N1_pool_heads   | January 2016 | adult heads      | HiSeq2000 | 
N1_pool_6-8h    | April 2016   | **6-8h** embryos | NextSeq High | Later time point + hand-picking of only fertilized eggs
N1sex_pool_6-8h | April 2016   | **6-8h** embryos | NextSeq High | Same as above, but with **male virginizers** and **female balancer** flies
F1_CyOTM3_headsFemale | Spring 2017 | adult female flies | NextSeq Mid | paternally balanced, so that 50:50 ratio is also on X. This is used to see whether we have more ASE on 2 and 3 than on X. 

# Update:

All data was re-aligned using STAR 2.5.2a and the proper FlyBASE GFF (version 6.05) in October 2017!

> Note: this is still ongoing (Oct 13 2017)
